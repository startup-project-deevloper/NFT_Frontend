If you want a small business investment you can create a FT Pod, and in exchange for an investment investors receive fungible Pod tokens.

Pod creators can apply to have their assets insured, or Insurance pools can contact Pod creators themselves. If a Pod is insured, for example if a property Title and the property itself is insured, the Physical NFT Pod is much more likely to generate investor interest. Insurance pools are started by known entities (Image is just an example) and unknown entities and users can invest in the Insurance pools, in exchange for PRIVI Insurance Coins which earn interest from the Pod.
